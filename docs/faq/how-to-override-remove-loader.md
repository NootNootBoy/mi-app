# How to override / remove splash screen and page loader ?

A splash screen is a screen that is visible at the first time of launching or refreshing any page or project.

Please refer to [this](/guide/development/loaders.html#splash-screen-loader-with-logo) docs if a user wants to override the splash screen.

A page loader is a loader that is visible when a route is changed (or when someone goes from one page to another).

Please refer to [this](/guide/development/loaders.html#pace-loader-page-loader) docs if a user wants to override the page loader.
