# How to change Logo / Branding ?

The main question here is, How can you change your branding in the core components like vertical / horizontal menu as we do not suggest to make any changes in the `src/@core` directory.

Please refer following docs in order to override Logo / Branding in Vertical menu:

[Vertical Menu Logo / Branding Change](/guide/layout/layout-overrides.html#_1-app-logo)

Please refer following docs in order to override Logo / Branding in Horizontal menu:

[Horizontal Menu Logo / Branding Change](/guide/layout/layout-overrides.html#_1-app-logo-2)

There are many other instances where you will have to change Logo / Branding like Login, Registration, Invoice pages but as they are not inside the `src/@core` directory, you don't need to worry and just remove our Logo / Branding code and replace it with your code.
