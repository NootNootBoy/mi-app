# How to override component's styling ?

Please refer to [MUI Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theme-components/) if a user is to override MUI's components.

We have created some components which will provide styles to some components.

A user may go through the [docs](/guide/components/styled-components.html) to understand how to use these styled components.

If a user wants to override those styled components, please refer to [this](/guide/components/styled-components.html#override-styled-components) docs.

If a user wants to override the styles of React Hot Toast, please refer to [this](/guide/components/styled-components.html#react-hot-toast) docs.
