# How to update this template ?

We are making template update as easy as possible from our side. We create our folder structure which makes updating process easier than ever. 😍

::: tip
If you are using React only version then mostly replacing @core folder in your project is enough. Still, verifying if something outside of @core is changed or not is always helpful and keeps you error free. 😇
