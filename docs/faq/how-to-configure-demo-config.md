# How to Configure local template to look like one of the 6 demos you see online ?

When you run the template for the first time your local template will always look like 1st demo you saw from the store.

There are 6 demos in total and you may want your local template to look like any of the demos you saw online.

To achieve this, we provide a `demo-configs` folder in the package and you can easily override configs with the help of those demo config files.

Please refer to [demo configs doc](/guide/development/demo-config.html) to change the demo config and make it look like you wanted.
