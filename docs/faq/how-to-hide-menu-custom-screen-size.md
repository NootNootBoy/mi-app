# How to change screen size to hide menu ?

The main question is what will happen to the navigation menu in screen size smaller than desktop and laptop. We hide the navigation menu inside a drawer which would be accessible from the Hamburger menu icon in the navbar. Currently, we hide the navigation menu below MUI's `lg` breakpoint.

A user has the freedom to change the breakpoint from which the user wants to hide the navigation menu.

Please refer to [this](/guide/layout/layout-overrides.html#_6-hide-menu-based-on-screen-size) docs to change the breakpoint in the Vertical layout.

Please refer to [this](/guide/layout/layout-overrides.html#_3-hide-menu-based-on-screen-size) docs to change the breakpoint in the Horizontal layout.
